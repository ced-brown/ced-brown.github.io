							<h2>PLAN</h2>
							<p>This is where the team and I planned out the project accordingly based off of the requirements document that was created. We took the time to brainstorm, research and prep. When doing this we made sure to pay attention to the goals and details that were layed out in the requirments document. 
							To ensure our services met the requirements by the client we familiarized ourselfs with the project by analyzing it further and utilizing the AGILE principles. We kept an open line of communication with the client throughout the entire project which assisted us greatly in being able to satisfy the client expectations. If there were any changes or modifications on the client end we made sure to implement those changes accordingly. </p>

							<h2>DESIGN</h2>
							<p>SKETCH, WIREFRAME, PROTOTYPE, DEVELOP.<br />
							Here we established the architecture on pen and paper. After more analysis and research the wireframe and prototyping was designed with Adobe XD. Then came the development.</p>

							<h2>DEVELOP</h2>
							<p>DJANGO was the python based tool we used for development and imported Excel data sheets into the SQLite3 database. With AGILE principles in play we were able to catch errors and have better accuracy for things such as the project completion date. Using github as a source control allowed the client and teammates to report issues that could be fixed or implemented.<br /> 
							NGROK was used for testing the app publicly so that the client could test the app from any device that is connected to the internet.</p>
